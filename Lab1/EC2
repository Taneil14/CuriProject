In Lab 1, I created and configured an Amazon EC2 instance using AWS Management Console.
After downloading and securing the PEM key, I successfully connected to the instance 
through SSH using Git Bash. Once connected, I was able to install and created an Apache Webserver,
deployed a custom HTML test page, and verified that the web server was accessible through
the instance's public IP address.
